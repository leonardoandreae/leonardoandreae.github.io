Hello!

My name is Leonardo and I am a Mechanical Engineer (MSc ETH) with a strong background in software development, robotics, and control systems.  

Over the past years, I have worked as an Embedded Software Engineer in the automotive industry, where I contributed to the development of Battery Management Systems (BMS) and Body Control Modules (BCM). My work included application software development in C, model-based design with Matlab, Simulink and Stateflow, and the integration and testing of CAN-based devices. I also gained extensive experience in agile development processes, coding standards, and both Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) testing.  

During my Master’s degree at ETH Zürich, my coursework was strongly focused on automatic control, robotics, and advanced system modeling, with projects on mobile legged and wheeled robots, path planning, state estimation, and optimization. This academic foundation, combined with international experience at the University of Waterloo and an internship at F&P Robotics, solidified my knowledge of robotic systems and motivated my long-term interest in the field.

My teaching assistant experience also enabled me to strenghten my oral presentation skills, displaying my work beautifully and helping other people succeed.

I am currently **seeking new opportunities in robotics software engineering**, and I am open to both full-time positions and internships that allow me to hone my skills and continue to grow in this domain. To ease this career transition, I am pursuing independent studies in mobile robotics, C++17/20, Python, and software engineering practices, ensuring that my knowledge remains up to date with the current industry standards.  

Outside of work, I enjoy a wide range of activities that keep me creative, active, and connected with others.

Going to the cinema is one of my favorite pastimes, especially as a social activity. I often go with friends, and sometimes we gather afterwards to discuss the movie — from the storytelling and direction to the soundtrack and cinematography.

I am also an avid PC gamer, particularly fond of action RPGs and metroidvanias. I enjoy the thrill of nonlinear level design, fast-paced action, and the sense of discovery these games offer. Gaming also fuels my curiosity about interactive design and technology.

Cooking is another passion of mine, as it allows me to express creativity while also caring for others. Preparing a meal for guests is my way of showing appreciation and hospitality, and I find great joy in creating dishes that bring people together.

In winter, skiing is by far my favorite activity. It gives me the chance to reconnect with old friends while enjoying the breathtaking scenery of the Swiss Alps. In summer, I turn to scuba diving whenever possible — an activity that never ceases to amaze me with the beauty and mystery of the underwater world.

Running is part of my routine as well. It helps me clear my mind, maintain balance, and reconnect with nature.

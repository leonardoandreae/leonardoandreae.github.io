Hello!

My name is Leonardo and I am a Mechanical Engineer (MSc ETH) with a strong background in software development, robotics, and control systems.  

Over the past years, I have worked as an Embedded Software Engineer in the automotive industry, where I contributed to the development of Battery Management Systems (BMS) and Body Control Modules (BCM). My work included application software development in C, model-based design with Matlab, Simulink and Stateflow, and the integration and testing of CAN-based devices. I also gained extensive experience in agile development processes, coding standards, and both Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) testing.  

During my Master’s degree at ETH Zürich, my coursework was strongly focused on automatic control, robotics, and advanced system modeling, with projects on mobile legged and wheeled robots, path planning, state estimation, and optimization. This academic foundation, combined with international experience at the University of Waterloo and an internship at F&P Robotics, solidified my knowledge of robotic systems and motivated my long-term interest in the field.

My teaching assistant experience also enabled me to strenghten my oral presentation skills, displaying my work beautifully and helping other people succeed.

I am currently **seeking new opportunities in robotics software engineering**, and I am open to both full-time positions and internships that allow me to hone my skills and continue to grow in this domain. To ease this career transition, I am pursuing independent studies in mobile robotics, C++17/20, Python, and software engineering practices, ensuring that my knowledge remains up to date with the current industry standards.  

Outside of work, I enjoy going to the cinema or hosting movie nights with friends. I am also an avid PC gamer, I especially love aRPGs and metroidvanias for their nonlinear level design, exploration and fast-paced action. Cooking is another passion of mine — it’s my way of sharing good moments and care for others. In terms of outside activities, I adore skiing in winter and, whenever possible, scuba diving in sommer.

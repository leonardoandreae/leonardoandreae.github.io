## General Information

**Start Date**: August 2019

**Duration**: 3-4 months

**Location**: Glattbrugg, Switzerland

**Employer**: F&P Robotics

**Tags**: robotic arm, pick-and-place, Python, modbus, software development, industrial application

## Project Description

### Background

This project was the main focus of my six-month internship at **F&P Robotics**, where I had the opportunity to contribute directly to the development of an industrial automation solution.  

The client required a robotic system capable of handling a complete **pick-and-place workflow for bottles and cans**, which included labeling, filling with liquid, capping, and finally placing them into dedicated containers. The solution was provided with **P-Rob** (see image below), a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm developed by F&P, mounted on a linear axis. The robot was integrated into the facility’s production environment through a **Modbus-based communication system**, ensuring seamless interaction with other equipment.

### Responsibilities and Contributions

My responsibility was **writing the software** that governed the robot’s behavior as well as testing the robustness of the entire system.

Using the company’s Python-based frontend application, I programmed the robot to execute the entire sequence of operations. This involved defining precise poses and trajectories, coordinating the timing of gripper opening and closing, and synchronizing the robot’s actions with the linear axis movement. Special care was taken to ensure repeatability, reliability, and safe operation within the industrial environment.

The robot was tested thoroughly in different operating conditions to tune the application parameters optimally and guarantee a long term, maintainable and robust system for the client.

### Outcome and Key Learnings

The project gave me valuable first-hand exposure to the realities of industrial robotics, where theoretical algorithms meet practical challenges such as system integration, timing constraints, and robustness under continuous operation. It also allowed me to **strengthen my Python programming skills** in a real-world setting and gain experience in adapting software to meet the requirements of a customer-driven application.  

Overall, this internship provided an important step in my professional development, bridging the gap between academic robotics projects and applied industrial solutions, and confirming my interest in pursuing a career in robotics and automation.
